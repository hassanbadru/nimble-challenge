## About The Project

### Specification

1. When the user clicks a row in the list of candidates, it should expand a list of that candidate's applications. If the user clicks a row that is already expanded, it should close the list of that candidate's applications.
2. When the user clicks an application line item, bring up a modal/overlay that shows the candidate information and information specific to that application/role. Modal code has been provided in src/ui-kit/Modal.jsx, but feel free to use your own if you'd like.
